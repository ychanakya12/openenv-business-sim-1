# Business Simulation Environment

> **Meta × PyTorch Hackathon — Round 1 Submission**
> OpenEnv-compatible multi-agent business simulation environment.

An AI CEO agent manages a software company across quarters, making strategic
decisions under uncertainty, adversarial conditions, and dynamic market forces.

---

## 🎯 Environment Overview

The agent plays the role of a CEO choosing which projects to accept, how to
invest in the team, and how to manage risk — with every decision having
delayed, cascading consequences.

**Three autonomous agents:**
| Agent | Role |
|---|---|
| **Decision Agent** (LLM) | CEO — makes quarterly strategic decisions |
| **Market Agent** | Simulates boom/stable/recession cycles via Markov chain |
| **Adversarial Agent** | Injects realistic shocks — client disputes, dev quits, audits |

---

## ⚡ Key Factors Modelled

| # | Factor | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Profit Potential** | `base_profit × market_demand × tech_multiplier` |
| 2 | **Risk Level** | `base_risk + skill_gap + burnout + hidden_risk` |
| 3 | **Team Capability** | Skill gap drives failure probability |
| 4 | **Deadline Pressure** | Tight deadlines increase team burnout |
| 5 | **Market Demand** | Domain demand shifts each quarter (Markov chain) |
| 6 | **Reputation Impact** | Per-project gain/loss; affects future pipeline |
| + | **Burnout / Resources** | Overloaded team degrades skill, increases errors |

## 🛠️ Setup & Running

### Local (no Docker)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn src.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7860
```

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t business-sim-env .
docker run -p 7860:7860 business-sim-env
```

### Run inference agent

```bash
export API_BASE_URL="https://router.huggingface.co/v1"
export MODEL_NAME="openai/gpt-oss-120b"
export HF_TOKEN=HF_TOKEN
export ENV_URL="http://localhost:7860"

python inference.py
```

### Pre-submission validation

```bash
# With server running in another terminal:
python validate.py
```

## 🌍 Real-World Relevance

Unlike toy environments, this simulation models:
- **Delayed consequences** — cheap tech stack causes bugs 2 quarters later
- **Compounding effects** — burnout degrades skill, which increases project risk
- **Market dynamics** — demand shifts force strategy adaptation
- **Hidden uncertainty** — `hidden_risk` simulates scope creep and client changes
- **Counterfactual reasoning** — `/state` returns what would have happened differently
